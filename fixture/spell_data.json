Each creature within the area must make a Constitution saving\nthrow. On a failed save, a creature takes 10d6 cold damage. On a\nsuccessful save, it takes half as much damage.\n\nIf the globe strikes a body of water or a liquid that is principally\nwater (not including water based creatures), it freezes the liquid to a\ndepth of 6 inches over an area 30 feet square. This ice lasts for 1\nminute. Creatures that were swimming on the surface of frozen water are\ntrapped in the ice. A trapped creature can use an action to make a\nStrength check against your spell save DC to break free.\n\nYou can refrain from firing the globe after completing the spell, if\nyou wish. A small globe about the size of a sling stone, cool to the\ntouch, appears in your hand. At any time, you or a creature you give\nthe globe to can throw the globe (to a range of 40 feet) or hurl it\nwith a sling (to the sling's normal range). It shatters on impact, with\nthe same effect as the normal casting of the spell. You can also set\nthe globe down without shattering it. After 1 minute, if the globe\nhasn't already shattered, it explodes.\n\n**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of\n7th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level\nabove 6th.",

That entity sends a celestial, an elemental, or a fiend loyal to\nit to aid you, making the creature appear in an unoccupied space within\nrange. If you know a specific creature's name, you can speak that name\nwhen you cast this spell to request that creature, though you might get\na different creature anyway (GM's choice).\n\nWhen the creature appears, it is under no compulsion to behave in any\nparticular way. You can ask the creature to perform a service in\nexchange for payment, but it isn't obliged to do so. The requested task\ncould range from simple (fly us across the chasm, or help us fight a\nbattle) to complex (spy on our enemies, or protect us during our foray\ninto the dungeon). You must be able to communicate with the creature to\nbargain for its services.\n\nPayment can take a variety of forms. A celestial might require a\nsizable donation of gold or magic items to an allied temple, while a\nfiend might demand a living sacrifice or a gift of treasure. Some\ncreatures might exchange their service for a quest undertaken by you.\n\nAs a rule of thumb, a task that can be measured in minutes requires a\npayment worth 100 gp per minute. A task measured in hours requires\n1,000 gp per hour. And a task measured in days (up to 10 days) requires\n10,000 gp per day. The GM can adjust these payments based on the\ncircumstances under which you cast the spell. If the task is aligned\nwith the creature's ethos, the payment might be halved or even waived.\nNonhazardous tasks typically require only half the suggested payment,\nwhile especially dangerous tasks might require a greater gift.\nCreatures rarely accept tasks that seem suicidal.\n\nAfter the creature completes the task, or when the agreed upon duration\nof service expires, the creature returns to its home plane after\nreporting back to you, if appropriate to the task and if possible.\n\nIf you are unable to agree on a price for the creature's service, the\ncreature immediately returns to its home plane.\n\nA creature enlisted to join your group counts as a member of it,\nreceiving a full share of experience points awarded.",

You\ncan also specify creatures that don't trigger the glyph, such as those\nwho say a certain password.\n\nWhen you inscribe the glyph, choose one of the options below for its\neffect.

If it\nsucceeds, the spell ends.

The glyph can cover\nan area no larger than 10 feet in diameter. If the surface or object is\nmoved more than 10 feet from where you cast this spell, the glyph is\nbroken, and the spell ends without being triggered.\n\nThe glyph is nearly invisible and requires a successful Intelligence\n(Investigation) check against your spell save DC to be found.\n\nYou decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs\ninscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or\nstanding on the glyph, removing another object covering the glyph,\napproaching within a certain distance of the glyph, or manipulating the\nobject on which the glyph is inscribed. For glyphs inscribed within an\nobject, the most common triggers include opening that object,\napproaching within a certain distance of the object, or seeing or\nreading the glyph. Once a glyph is triggered, this spell ends.\n\nYou can further refine the trigger so the spell activates only under\ncertain circumstances or according to physical characteristics (such as\nheight or weight), creature kind (for example, the ward could be set to\naffect aberrations or drow), or alignment. You can also set conditions\nfor creatures that don't trigger the glyph, such as those who say a\ncertain password.\n\nWhen you inscribe the glyph, choose explosive runes or a spell glyph.\n\n**Explosive Runes.** When triggered, the glyph erupts with magical\nenergy in a 20 foot radius sphere centered on the glyph. The sphere\nspreads around corners. Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity\nsaving throw. A creature takes 5d8 acid, cold, fire, lightning, or\nthunder damage on a failed saving throw (your choice when you create\nthe glyph), or half as much damage on a successful one.\n\n**Spell Glyph.** You can store a prepared spell of 3rd level or lower\nin the glyph by casting it as part of creating the glyph. The spell\nmust target a single creature or an area. The spell being stored has no\nimmediate effect when cast in this way. When the glyph is triggered,\nthe stored spell is cast. If the spell has a target, it targets the\ncreature that triggered the glyph. If the spell affects an area, the\narea is centered on that creature. If the spell summons hostile\ncreatures or creates harmful objects or traps, they appear as close as\npossible to the intruder and attack it. If the spell requires\nconcentration, it lasts until the end of its full duration.\n\n**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of\n4th level or higher, the damage of an explosive runes glyph increases\nby 1d8 for each slot level above 3rd. If you create a spell glyph, you\ncan store any spell of up to the same level as the slot you use for the\nglyph of warding.",

            "description": "Wish is the mightiest spell a mortal creature can cast. By simply\nspeaking aloud, you can alter the very foundations of reality in accord\nwith your desires.\n\nThe basic use of this spell is to duplicate any other spell of 8th\nlevel or lower. You don't need to meet any requirements in that spell,\nincluding costly components. The spell simply takes effect.\n\nAlternatively, you can create one of the following effects of your\nchoice:\n\n- You create one object of up to 25,000 gp in value that isn't a magic\n  item. The object can be no more than 300 feet in any dimension, and\n  it appears in an unoccupied space you can see on the ground.\n\n- You allow up to twenty creatures that you can see to regain all hit\n  points, and you end all effects on them described in the greater\n  restoration spell.\n\n- You grant up to ten creatures that you can see resistance to a damage\n  type you choose.\n\n- You grant up to ten creatures you can see immunity to a single spell\n  or other magical effect for 8 hours. For instance, you could make\n  yourself and all your companions immune to a lich's life drain attack.\n\n- You undo a single recent event by forcing a reroll of any roll made\n  within the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes\n  itself to accommodate the new result. For example, a wish spell could\n  undo an opponent's successful save, a foe's critical hit, or a\n  friend's failed save. You can force the reroll to be made with\n  advantage or disadvantage, and you can choose whether to use the\n  reroll or the original roll.\n\n- You might be able to achieve something beyond the scope of the above\n  examples. State your wish to the GM as precisely as possible. The GM\n  has great latitude in ruling what occurs in such an instance; the\n  greater the wish, the greater the likelihood that something goes\n  wrong. This spell might simply fail, the effect you desire might only\n  be partly achieved, or you might suffer some unforeseen consequence\n  as a result of how you worded the wish. For example, wishing that a\n  villain were dead might propel you forward in time to a period when\n  that villain is no longer alive, effectively removing you from the\n  game. Similarly, wishing for a legendary magic item or artifact might\n  instantly transport you to the presence of the item's current owner.\n\nThe stress of casting this spell to produce any effect other than\nduplicating another spell weakens you. After enduring that stress, each\ntime you cast a spell until you finish a long rest, you take 1d10\nnecrotic damage per level of that spell. This damage can't be reduced\nor prevented in any way. In addition, your Strength drops to 3, if it\nisn't 3 or lower already, for 2d4 days. For each of those days that you\nspend resting and doing nothing more than light activity, your\nremaining recovery time decreases by 2 days. Finally, there is a 33\npercent chance that you are unable to cast wish ever again if you\nsuffer this stress.",

The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be\nbound by the spell; if it succeeds, it is immune to this spell if you\ncast it again. While affected by this spell, the creature doesn't need\nto breathe, eat, or drink, and it doesn't age. Divination spells can't\nlocate or perceive the target.\n\nWhen you cast the spell, you choose one of the following forms of\nimprisonment.\n\n**Burial.** The target is entombed far beneath the earth in a sphere of\nmagical force that is just large enough to contain the target.  Nothing\ncan pass through the sphere, nor can any creature teleport or use\nplanar travel to get into or out of it.\n\nThe special component for this version of the spell is a small mithral\norb.\n\n**Chaining.** Heavy chains, firmly rooted in the ground, hold the\ntarget in place. The target is restrained until the spell ends, and it\ncan't move or be moved by any means until then.\n\nThe special component for this version of the spell is a fine chain of\nprecious metal.\n\n**Hedged Prison.** The spell transports the target into a tiny\ndemiplane that is warded against teleportation and planar travel. The\ndemiplane can be a labyrinth, a cage, a tower, or any similar confined\nstructure or area of your choice.\n\nThe special component for this version of the spell is a miniature\nrepresentation of the prison made from jade.\n\n**Minimus Containment.** The target shrinks to a height of 1 inch and\nis imprisoned inside a gemstone or similar object. Light can pass\nthrough the gemstone normally (allowing the target to see out and other\ncreatures to see in), but nothing else can pass through, even by means\nof teleportation or planar travel. The gemstone can't be cut or broken\nwhile the spell remains in effect.\n\nThe special component for this version of the spell is a large,\ntransparent gemstone, such as a corundum, diamond, or ruby.\n\n**Slumber.** The target falls asleep and can't be awoken. The special\ncomponent for this version of the spell consists of rare soporific\nherbs.\n\n**Ending the Spell.** During the casting of the spell, in any of its\nversions, you can specify a condition that will cause the spell to end\nand release the target. The condition can be as specific or as\nelaborate as you choose, but the GM must agree that the condition is\nreasonable and has a likelihood of coming to pass. The conditions can\nbe based on a creature's name, identity, or deity but otherwise must be\nbased on observable actions or qualities and not based on intangibles\nsuch as level, class, or hit points.\n\nA dispel magic spell can end the spell only if it is cast as a 9th\nlevel spell, targeting either the prison or the special component used\nto create it.\n\nYou can use a particular special component to create only one prison at\na time. If you cast the spell again using the same component, the\ntarget of the first casting is immediately freed from its binding.",

You can choose from\nany of the following effects when you cast this spell. As an action on\nyour turn, you can repeat the same effect or choose a different one.\n\n**Flood.** You cause the water level of all standing water in the area\nto rise by as much as 20 feet. If the area includes a shore, the\nflooding water spills over onto dry land.\n\nIf you choose an area in a large body of water, you instead create a 20\nfoot tall wave that travels from one side of the area to the other and\nthen crashes down. Any Huge or smaller vehicles in the wave's path are\ncarried with it to the other side. Any Huge or smaller vehicles struck\nby the wave have a 25 percent chance of capsizing.\n\nThe water level remains elevated until the spell ends or you choose a\ndifferent effect. If this effect produced a wave, the wave repeats on\nthe start of your next turn while the flood effect lasts.\n\n**Part Water.** You cause water in the area to move apart and create a\ntrench. The trench extends across the spell's area, and the separated\nwater forms a wall to either side. The trench remains until the spell\nends or you choose a different effect. The water then slowly fills in\nthe trench over the course of the next round until the normal water\nlevel is restored.\n\n**Redirect Flow.** You cause flowing water in the area to move in a\ndirection you choose, even if the water has to flow over obstacles, up\nwalls, or in other unlikely directions. The water in the area moves as\nyou direct it, but once it moves beyond the spell's area, it resumes\nits flow based on the terrain conditions. The water continues to move\nin the direction you chose until the spell ends or you choose a\ndifferent effect.\n\n**Whirlpool.** This effect requires a body of water at least 50 feet\nsquare and 25 feet deep. You cause a whirlpool to form in the center of\nthe area. The whirlpool forms a vortex that is 5 feet wide at the base,\nup to 50 feet wide at the top, and 25 feet tall. Any creature or object\nin the water and within 25 feet of the vortex is pulled 10 feet toward\nit. A creature can swim away from the vortex by making a Strength\n(Athletics) check against your spell save DC.\n\nWhen a creature enters the vortex for the first time on a turn or\nstarts its turn there, it must make a Strength saving throw.

A creature caught in\nthe vortex can use its action to try to swim away from the vortex as\ndescribed above, but has disadvantage on the Strength (Athletics) check\nto do so.\n\nThe first time each turn that an object enters the vortex, the object\ntakes 2d8 bludgeoning damage; this damage occurs each round it remains\nin the vortex.",

While in the trance, the messenger\nis aware of his or her surroundings, but can't take actions or move.\n\nIf the target is asleep, the messenger appears in the target's dreams\nand can converse with the target as long as it remains asleep, through\nthe duration of the spell. The messenger can also shape the environment\nof the dream, creating landscapes, objects, and other images. The\nmessenger can emerge from the trance at any time, ending the effect of\nthe spell early. The target recalls the dream perfectly upon waking. If\nthe target is awake when you cast the spell, the messenger knows it,\nand can either end the trance (and the spell) or wait for the target to\nfall asleep, at which point the messenger appears in the target's\ndreams.\n\nYou can make the messenger appear monstrous and terrifying to the\ntarget. If you do, the messenger can deliver a message of no more than\nten words and then the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a\nfailed save, echoes of the phantasmal monstrosity spawn a nightmare\nthat lasts the duration of the target's sleep and prevents the target\nfrom gaining any benefit from that rest. In addition, when the target\nwakes up, it takes 3d6 psychic damage.\n\nIf you have a body part, lock of hair, clipping from a nail, or similar\nportion of the target's body, the target makes its saving throw with\ndisadvantage.",

For example, if you tried to travel 120 miles, landed off\ntarget, and rolled a 5 and 3 on the two d10s, then you would be off\ntarget by 15 percent, or 18 miles. The GM determines the direction off\ntarget randomly by rolling a d8 and designating 1 as north, 2 as\nnortheast, 3 as east, and so on around the points of the compass. If\nyou were teleporting to a coastal city and wound up 18 miles out at\nsea, you could be in trouble.\n\n**Similar Area.** You and your group (or the target object) wind up in\na different area that's visually or thematically similar to the target\narea. If you are heading for your home laboratory, for example, you\nmight wind up in another wizard's laboratory or in an alchemical supply\nshop that has many of the same tools and implements as your laboratory.\nGenerally, you appear in the closest similar place, but since the spell\nhas no range limit, you could conceivably wind up anywhere on the plane.\n\n**Mishap.** The spell's unpredictable magic results in a difficult\njourney. Each teleporting creature (or the target object) takes 3d10\nforce damage, and the GM rerolls on the table to see where you wind up\n(multiple mishaps can occur, dealing damage each time).",

You and creatures you designate at the time\nyou cast the spell can pass through and remain near the wall without\nharm.  If another creature that can see the wall moves to within 20\nfeet of it or starts its turn there, the creature must succeed on a\nConstitution saving throw or become blinded for 1 minute.\n\nThe wall consists of seven layers, each with a different color. When a\ncreature attempts to reach into or pass through the wall, it does so\none layer at a time through all the wall's layers. As it passes or\nreaches through each layer, the creature must make a Dexterity saving\nthrow or be affected by that layer's properties as described below.\n\nThe wall can be destroyed, also one layer at a time, in order from red\nto violet, by means specific to each layer. Once a layer is destroyed,\nit remains so for the duration of the spell. An antimagic field has no\neffect on it.\n\n**1. Red.** The creature takes 10d6 fire damage on a failed save, or\nhalf as much damage on a successful one. While this layer is in place,\nnonmagical ranged attacks can't pass through the wall. The layer can be\ndestroyed by dealing at least 25 cold damage to it.\n\n**2. Orange.** The creature takes 10d6 acid damage on a failed save, or\nhalf as much damage on a successful one. While this layer is in place,\nmagical ranged attacks can't pass through the wall. The layer is\ndestroyed by a strong wind.\n\n**3. Yellow.** The creature takes 10d6 lightning damage on a failed\nsave, or half as much damage on a successful one. This layer can be\ndestroyed by dealing at least 60 force damage to it.\n\n**4. Green.** The creature takes 10d6 poison damage on a failed save,\nor half as much damage on a successful one. A passwall spell, or\nanother spell of equal or greater level that can open a portal on a\nsolid surface, destroys this layer.\n\n**5. Blue.** The creature takes 10d6 cold damage on a failed save, or\nhalf as much damage on a successful one. This layer can be destroyed by\ndealing at least 25 fire damage to it.\n\n**6. Indigo.** On a failed save, the creature is restrained. It must\nthen make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns.\nIf it successfully saves three times, the spell ends. If it fails its\nsave three times, it permanently turns to stone and is subjected to the\npetrified condition. The successes and failures don't need to be\nconsecutive; keep track of both until the creature collects three of a\nkind.\n\nWhile this layer is in place, spells can't be cast through the wall.\nThe layer is destroyed by bright light shed by a daylight spell or a\nsimilar spell of equal or higher level.\n\n**7. Violet.** On a failed save, the creature is blinded. It must then\nmake a Wisdom saving throw at the start of your next turn. A successful\nsave ends the blindness. If it fails that save, the creature is\ntransported to another plane of the GM's choosing and is no longer\nblinded. (Typically, a creature that is on a plane that isn't its home\nplane is banished home, while other creatures are usually cast into the\nAstral or Ethereal planes.)
